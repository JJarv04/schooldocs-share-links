# Schooldoc Share Links

This small extension allows you to quickly create sharelinks for Schooldocs documents with your tenant guid.

Features:
- Automatically detects and constructs shareable links to SchoolDocs documents you have open.
- Support PDF SchoolDocs documents as well.
- Lists document names & share links for multiple items open.
- Persist `School Guid` between browser restarts using chrome.storage.sync

- The extension uses `storage`, `scripting` and `activeTab` permissions. No host permissions are required to navigate the tab to the target URL.

This product is in no way affiliated with SchoolDocs; just a (potentially) handy feature.
